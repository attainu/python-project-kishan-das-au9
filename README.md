Introduction: 
Cab_booking offers any user to book a cab according to their own convinence via a mobile or a web application.
Here a person can book a ride or he can register himself as a driver for the rides of other people.

Motivation
It is one of the most required applicaton in todays lifestyle, a lot of people rely on online booking of cabs for the sake to transportation, since everyone needs concinence and do not want to go looking for a ride on field, hence they can use the Cab_booking and boo a ride s per their requirement.

So, I have created a Cab_booking Application which allows you to book a ride by registering oneself as a Rider or provide a ride by registering oneself as a Cab_driver.
